TODO
- why slight delay on first start, after not starting for a while
- does drone sound interfere with metro sound? (yes if too loud, is there way to automatically ensure there's no clipping?)
- beat width should adjust if there's a bunch of beats
- whole app flash on beat 
- more accurate tempo text
- metro volume (combine with snackbar if metro if turned on with volume 0)
- drone volume
- can users upload their own samples? 
- use localStorage to save last settings on device.
- can you include a tuner on here as well?

- polyrhythms and visualization would be fun.
- subdivisions 
- custom sound sample upload? 
- MUI bottom right + icon for my contact info, suggestions, etc.
