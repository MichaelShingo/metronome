TODO
- why slight delay on first start, after not starting for a while
- *** make good metronome sounds with synths
- custom sound sample upload? ]
- isn't there some crackle in the audio when you start drone or adjust volume? 

- tap tempo
- use localStorage to save last settings on device.
- MUI bottom right + icon for my contact info, suggestions, etc.

Extra features
- light/dark modes
- subdivisions 
- polyrhythms and visualization would be fun.
- create click tracks
- create practice sessions (after 4 beats, increase tempo...)
- can you include a tuner on here as well?
- can you collect user data (like how long they used the metronome, what tempos, etc., it could be anonymous)


- ESLint auto format - NEED TO RUN THIS ./node_modules/.bin/eslint --ini 
	- but use settings in here: https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/format-code-on-save-vs-code-eslint/#1-installing-eslint-optional-prettier
