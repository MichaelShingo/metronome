TODO before V1 Deploy
	- sample start time doesn't match synth start time on polyrhyths only
	- wouldn't it be nice if changing beatNUm didn't restart metro? 	

Extra features
- use localStorage to save last settings on device.
- isn't there some crackle in the audio when you start drone or adjust volume? 
- light/dark modes
- MUI bottom right + icon for my contact info, suggestions, etc.
- shouldn't there be + - buttons for both polyrhythms and regular beat ? And a way to set it by dropdown for main? 
Advanced features
- custom sound sample upload?
- create click tracks
- create practice sessions (after 4 beats, increase tempo...)
- can you include a tuner on here as well?
- can you collect user data (like how long they used the metronome, what tempos, etc., it could be anonymous)
- subdivisions of more speciifc rhythms, like syncopated


- ESLint auto format - NEED TO RUN THIS ./node_modules/.bin/eslint --ini 
	- but use settings in here: https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/format-code-on-save-vs-code-eslint/#1-installing-eslint-optional-prettier
	
	
- Testing libraries?

// resume audio context to prevent lag
