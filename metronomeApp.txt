TODO
- Metro sound type adjustments, metro pitch (slider)
	- have some standard presets
	- be able to set first beat and other beat sounds separately.
- why slight delay on first start, after not starting for a while
- drone should use Tone as well
- 4 pitch level options on each beat
	- store in single piece of state that is an object. Object contains mapping <beatNum, pitchNum>
	
- Shift + arrow keys to change beats.
- whole app flash on beat 
- metro volume (combine with snackbar if metro if turned on with volume 0)
- drone volume
- MUI bottom right + icon for my contact info, suggestions, etc. 
- Tooltip on hover beats
- Tooltip on beats adjustment + - 
- Settings tooltip should appear above or something
- can users upload their own samples?
